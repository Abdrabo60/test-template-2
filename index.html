        <h3>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h3>
        <p>
          The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
          companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not
          just development, but in every aspect of any business.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
          largest communities teaching young minds about how to
          <i>sell</i> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world
          of opportunities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
          holding you back yourself.
        </p>
        <p>A qoute I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
        <p>
          "How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't
          fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a
          developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in
          something you're <i>passionate</i> about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
          company.
